Dear viewer,

This is a simple Calculator made with React.

What is can do:
- simple calculations - adding, subtracting, multiplication, division.
- divide a number by 100 ( the '%' sign)
- clear input
- turn integers into fractions ( the '.' sign) 

Used dependencies:
-  React 
   
Things to bear in mind:
- when any of the four main operator buttons ( '+', '-', '*' , '/') is pressed the current value is removed from the screen ( I could not quite figure out how to keep the old value visible and allow the new value to be stored).

Please leave a comment.

Thank you!
